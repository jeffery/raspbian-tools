# Raspbian Tools
Scripts to manage a RaspberryPi device which is running Raspbian (http://www.raspbian.org). These scripts have only been
tested on openSUSE 12.3 distribution.

## raspbian-backup
This is a script to backup your RaspberryPi sd card from a block device. The block device is usually mounted via an SD
card reader. After inserting the SD card into a reader, you can backup the entire RaspberryPi operating system by
executing:

    ./raspbian-backup /dev/sdd .

The above command is reading the /dev/sdd block device and making a backup of it into the current directory. The script 
will create the backup image with a date timestamp. e.g. 2013-06-02_22h04m-raspberrypi.img

In order to know which block device was used for your card reader, you can verify by executing the command:

    dmesg
Usually you would see some messages from the kernel:

## raspbian-chroot
This script helps in creating a chroot environment for your RaspberryPi backup image which has Raspbian installed as the
Operating System.

It requires package qemu-linux-user and kpartx (or the equivalent for your distro of choice) to be installed. To start 
the chrooted environment, execute it with the path to an exported Raspbian image:

    ./raspbian-chroot 2013-06-02_22h04m-raspberrypi.img
    
## raspbian-arm-chroot
Script that does the same things that the **raspbian-chroot** does but
with the qemu emulation stripped out since this one is intended to
run on arm systems. 

Lets say you want to compile for the raspberry pi but you have a more 
powerful arm machine like the Odroid U3. This script will mount the 
raspbian image copy its contents to a separate directory and chroot to 
it. Copying the raspbian image content is itended to not run out of space 
(which happens if working directly on the rapsbian image) when compiling 
big projects.
